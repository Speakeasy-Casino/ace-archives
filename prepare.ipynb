       "'simplifi blackjack procedur learn goal util condit logic and loop gain an introduct to the command line interfac background in blackjackhttpenwikipediaorgwikiblackjack the goal is to have a hand that is closer to 21 than the dealer hand without ever exceed a card total of 21 howev in this simplifi version of blackjack well cut out that compar with the dealer hand part and pretend that the goal of the game is to have a card total of or veri close to but never exceed 21 to start a player get dealt two card each of which has valu between 111 then the player is ask if they want to hit get anoth card dealt to them or stay if they hit they get dealt anoth card if the sum of their three card exceed 21 theyv lost if it doe not they can decid to hit or stay again forev if your think but now there no way to win then youd be right in this simpl simpl version of blackjack there is no way to win onc youv complet this lab feel free to make a second version where there is a way to win mayb even includ the real rule and compar the user hand to the dealer hand the command line interfac a brief note this is a brief introduct to command line app it okay if you dont understand everyth we discuss here were go to take a more indepth look in your next command line applic the cli or command line interfac is the interact between a user and their comput or a program via the command line youv alreadi becom comfort interact with the command line to navig file and connect with github and test your program in a command line applic the user will respond to a prompt that your program will output to the termin the user respons or input will be receiv by the applic and the applic will then carri out the program respons base on that input how doe put output text to the termin how do the put and print method actual output text to your consol they use the stdout global variabl provid to us by rubi you dont need to worri about global variabl right now for the purpos of understand how put and print work we just need to understand the follow your comput has a stdout file that communic with your oper system so put and print actual send output to the stdout variabl the stdout variabl send that inform to the stdout file on your comput which in turn communic with your oper system which in turn output that inform to the consol you can absolut employ put and print without understand everyth that was just describ but now you have a basic sens of what is happen under the hood of these method run our command line app we alreadi know that we can run or execut the code in a rubi file from the command line by type rubi file name in a command line app it is convent to creat a special file that has one respons execut the code that constitut our program you can think about this in term of the separ of concern principl the separ of concern principl is a program design principl for separ the respons and function into discret section for our command line app that mean that we have one file that defin the method we will use to play our blackjack game and a separ file that call those method then we will play our game by execut the that runner file via rubi runnerrb in the command line test our command line app you alreadi know that your blackjack command line app will reli on the user input to run in order to test our program use rspec we need a way for our test suit to fake the user input ie fake the implement of the put and get method this is call stub what is stub stub refer to the fake implement of a method in this case we will stub the put method to trick our test suit into think the stdout file has receiv the put method and to trick our test suit into recogn that the get method has been use first rubi expectstdoutto receiveputswithtyp h to hit or s to stay the abov line mean that the test suit is expect the execut of a certain method to use the put method to output type h to hit or s to stay second rubi expectselfto receivegetuserinputandreturn the abov line mean that the test suit itself is expect the execut of a certain method getuserinput to use the get method to store the user input and return that input which in this particular test happen to be s enact a rubi program via a runner method it is common practic to break down the constitu part of a larger program into smaller method each method should be respons for one job these method can be call in success insid a larger method to enact the run of the program for exampl if we were write a simpl app to greet a user and ask them their name we might have a short method to output a welcom messag anoth method to ask them their name a third method to captur the user input a fourth method to output a new person greet that use that input and a last method that call on each of the smaller method to make the whole thing run our shorter method might look like this rubi def welcom put hi end def asknam put what is your name end def storenam getschomp end def personalizedwelcomenam put hi name end to run our program we need to call all of these method instead of call each of them in turn we might place them insid a singl method then to enact our program we onli have to invok our one wrapper or runner method rubi def runprogram welcom asknam name storenam personalizedwelcomenam end the runprogram method can then be invok insid of a runner file discuss abov such a file would onli need to contain one line rubi runner file runprogram this is the basic pattern that we will be use to code our simpl blackjack game in the first part of this lab well be defin our smaller method each of which is respons for one discret unit of the game these method are call helper method onc we have all of our helper method test pass well defin the runner method that call on each of the helper method in turn to make the program run instruct all your code will go in libblackjackrb onc everi test is work run rubi librunnerrb from the root directori to play use tdd this lab is test driven so run learn to guid you through the program read the test output veri care pay attent to whether or not the test is tell you that the method should be defin to take in an argument pay attent to what the test expect the return valu of the method to be were go to take a look at one exampl togeth and for the rest of the method youll be requir to let the test guid you in the test suit we have the follow test rubi describ displaycardtot do it accept one argument the card total do expect displaycardtotal7 tonot raiseerror end it print the valu of the card to the screen do expectstdoutto receiveputswithyour card add up to 8 displaycardtotal8 end this test is tell us the follow thing about the method call displaycardtot the method should take in an argument of a number that is the card total the method should use put to output that card total as part of the phrase your card add up to card total defin our method the welcom method this method use put to output the messag welcom to the blackjack tabl the dealcard method this method generat and return a random number between 1 and 11 the displaycardtot method this method accept an argument of a number and put out the phrase your card add up to cardtot the number that this method take in as an argument is the sum of a player card this method will be call insid anoth method at which point the real sum of a player card will be pass in as an argument this is not import right now just defin the method to take in a number and put out the appropri phrase use that number the promptus method this method ask the user for input by output the phrase type h to hit or s to stay the getuserinput method this method is veri basic it onli need to use the get method to captur the user input eventu when we take all of these helper method and assembl them into the larger method that enact the gameplay this method will be use after we prompt the user for input to actual captur and store their input the endgam method this method take in an argument of a number which will be a player card total and output the messag sorri you hit cardtot thank for play the initialround method this method repres the first round of the game for a given player it should call on the dealcard method twice use the displaycardtot method to put out the sum and then return the sum this method will therefor call on two other helper method dealcard and displaycardtot which take in an argument of the sum of both invoc of dealcard the hit method this method is a bit more complex it should take in an argument of the player current card total so set up your hit method to take in an argument of a number then the method should use the promptus method to prompt the user for input and the getuserinput method to get and store the user input now we need to implement some logic if the player input is s we dont deal a new card if the player input is h we do need to deal a new card in this case use the dealcard method to deal a new card and increment the player card total by whatev number is return by dealcard if the player input is neither h nor s call on the invalidcommand method to output the phrase pleas enter a valid command then call on the promptus method again to remind your user what a valid command is in either case our method should then return the player current card total the runner method runner onc you get all of the test in the first part of the test suit pass you have built the build block of our blackjack game now we need to put them all togeth in the runner method the runner method is respons for enact the gameplay until the user lose rememb that a player lose if the sum of their card exceed 21 here how we want our game to run 1 welcom the user 2 deal them their first two card ie their initialround 3 ask them if they want to hit or stay 4 if they want to stay ask them again 5 if they want to hit deal anoth card and display the new total 6 if their card total exceed 21 the game end use a loop constructor id recommend until but that is by no mean your onli option to enact the abov gameplay in the runner method then check out the librunnerrb file notic that it is simpli call the runner method the runner file will call the runner method which should in turn util all the other method you built resourc wikipediahttpenwikipediaorg blackjackhttpenwikipediaorgwikiblackjack p
